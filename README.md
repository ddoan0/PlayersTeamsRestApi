# Base Project for TMA Spring Boot Test

You are welcome to use anything in this project to help you with the assessment test.

This application has an H2 database preconfigured along with several Spring Boot dependencies you may need. This H2
database can be viewed at http://localhost:8080/h2-console when the application is running. Use `jdbc:h2:mem:testDb`
as the JDBC console, `sa` for the username, and leave the password blank in order to connect.
